# TheJourney
30-day challenge application using React, MongoDB and MaterialUI

## Description

The Journey is a 30-day challenge application designed to allow users to ignite personal growth and empower themselves to reach their full potential. The motivation behind this project is to give users the opportunity to plant the seeds that will allow their goals to come to fruition.

"A dream without a plan is just a dream."
- Bryan Tracy

The problem our application aims to solve is inaction and lack of direction.
We aim to assist users to develop strategic thinking, setting objectives, a clear roadmap to achieve their goals and more importantly taking action.
